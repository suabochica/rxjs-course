## RxJs Error Handling Guide
Error handling is an essential part of RxJs, as we will need it in just about any reactive program that we write.

Error handling in RxJs is likely not as well understood as other parts of the library, but it is actually quite simple to understand if we _focus on understanding first_ the Observable contract in general.

Also, it is recommendable keep in mind the **most common error handling strategies** that you will need in order to cover most practical scenarios, starting with the basis of the Observable contract. These strategies are:

- The catch and replace strategy
- throwError and the catch and rethrow strategy
- The retry strategy
- The immediate retry strategy
- The delayed retry strategy
