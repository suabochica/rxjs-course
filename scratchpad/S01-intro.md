## RxJs In Practice Course Helicopter View
Please, check the README.md file to check the contents that will attended in the course.

## Recommended Software Versions
Hello everyone,

Just a quick note to let you know that the current recommended node version for this course is:

- Node 12

Please use this version of node, which is compatible with the `package-lock.json` available in the repository. This will avoid any semantic versioning issues, and ensure you a smooth installation and course taking experience.

## The TypeScript Jumpstart Ebook
This course will be in the Typescript language, which is closely related to other languages that you are *likely already familiar with*. 

But it that is not the case, we have here a **E-Book aimed at getting you started quickly with the language**, so that you can focus on the Advanced Angular features presented during the course.

Before starting setting up your development environment, please take a moment to download the Typescript Jumpstart Ebook, that is available together with this video course:

This book covers the *Typescript Type System* and the multiples *Type Definitions*, which are the most unique parts of the language that are a bit different from other closely related languages. 

### This Book In a Nutshell ###
This book is aimed at  developers that want to get a *deeper understanding of Typescript*. If you have been trying to learn or use Typescript and would now like to go deeper into the language and learn how to make the most of its **powerful type system**, then this book is for you.

### What is the core value proposition of this book? ###
Sit down in one *evening* with this book, and learn the **key aspects** of the language and its type system that might take months of experience and long stackoverflow sessions to gather the hard way.

Become a lot more comfortable using Typescript on a daily basis, learn quickly the fundamentals of the language so that you can focus on other things in your project.

### Why a Fast-track Guide to Typescript? ###
Typescript combines many of the best features of **statically-typed languages**, together with some of the best features of **dynamically-typed languages**.

So this means that if you already know one of the following: Javascript /ES6, Java, C#, Ruby Python, you will notice many overlapping features. So you already know a lot about Typescript, and only really need to learn what is unique about it.

### A Deceivingly Familiar Language! ###
Many times developers can just jump right into the language without any formal training, because the **language looks** so familiar. And this is very often the case in the Angular Ecosystem for example, where we often just start using the language straight away.

But you might notice that some things just don't work as expected: for example, compiler error messages show up for something that apparently should just work.

The problem is that the Typescript type system **works in a very different way** than the type systems of the most popular statically typed languages, and there are good reasons for that.

The familiarity with other languages is a great feature, but that familiarity alone might not be enough for a comfortable development experience.

To get the most out of Typescript, we really need to take a moment to **dive deeper into its type system**, and that is what this book is specifically about.

### I'm a Javascript Developer, is this book for me? ###

If you are afraid that using Typescript means a lot of ceremony and verbosity for just a bit of tooling, in this book you will learn that we can actually have the **best of both worlds in Typescript**:

we can write very concise code with almost no type annotations, but still benefit from all the tooling like auto-completion and refactoring working out-of-the-box.
